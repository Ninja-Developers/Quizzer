## Setting up local Development server 
This application is built on **MERN** stack and using typescript in backend and react with javascript in client. 
To run this application you need **nodejs**, installed in your computer, you can install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Steps to follow:
- clone this repository
- install the dependencies, the client is not working seperately, so you have to install dependencies seperately, 
  - First run `npm install` in the root folder 
  - Then run `npm install` in the client forlder 
- To run the server run `npm run dev` in the root folder
- To run the client run `cd client` then run `npm start`
- Server runs on `PORT:5000` and client runs on `PORT:3000`
